# ADC-PopPK-model-Reproduce
Learn and practice PK/PD modelling for antibody-drug conjugates
Until now, the ADC has usually used a sequential method to build up the PopPK model.
Here, I would like to learn and practice or even summarize the characteristics of these ADC PopPK models.
Welcome all the others who are interested in discussing this topic.

### 1. Mechanism of Action
Sacituzumab govitecan contains a humanized monoclonal antibody hRS7 IgG1 which targets Trop-2. The antibody portion is linked to SN-38, the small molecule portion, via a hydrolysable linker. Sacituzumab govitecan induces DNA damage, leading to apoptosis.

### 2. Indications
##### Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (mTNBC):
For adult patients who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, with at least one therapy for metastatic disease.
##### Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma (UC):
For adult patients who have previously received platinum-containing chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.

### 3. Pharmacokinetics (PK)
##### Absorption: 
sacituzumab govitecan is administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion.
##### Distribution: 
The mean volume of distribution of sacituzumab govitecan is 0.045 L/kg.
##### Metabolism: 
UGT1A1 is involved in the metabolism of SN-38, the small molecule portion of sacituzumab govitecan, to form SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G).
##### Elimination: 
the mean terminal half-life of sacituzumab govitecan is 16 hours and SN-38 is 18 hours.

Scientists from Gilead Sciences, Inc. published this paper:
"Three population pharmacokinetic models were constructed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling; clinically relevant covariates were evaluated to assess their impact on exposure. Models for SG and tAB were developed independently whereas free SN-38 was sequentially generated via a first-order release process from SG."
