# ADC-PopPK-model-Reproduce
Learn and practice PK/PD modelling for antibody-drug conjugates

Until now, the ADC has usually used a sequential method to build up the PopPK model.
Here, I would like to learn and practice or even summarize the characteristics of these ADC PopPK models.
Welcome all the others who are interested in discussing this topic.

## 1. Troldelvy
### 1. Mechanism of Action
#### Type: Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC)
#### Target: Trop-2
Trop-2 (Trophoblast cell-surface antigen-2) is a surface protein that is overexpressed in various cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and bladder cancer.
#### Mechanism:
Trodelvy consists of an anti-Trop-2 monoclonal antibody linked to SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan (a topoisomerase I inhibitor).
The antibody binds to Trop-2 overexpressed on cancer cells.
Once internalized, SN-38 is released inside the cells, causing DNA damage and leading to cell death.
### 2. Indications
#### Trodelvy is approved for the treatment of the following cancers (specific indications may vary by country):
##### Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (mTNBC):
For adult patients who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, with at least one therapy for metastatic disease.
TNBC is an aggressive form of breast cancer with limited treatment options.
##### Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma (UC):
For adult patients who have previously received platinum-containing chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.
### 3. Pharmacokinetics (DMPK)
#### Route of Administration: Intravenous (IV) infusion.
#### Half-Life:
The sacituzumab component has a half-life of approximately 15-16 hours.
The SN-38 payload has a slightly longer half-life.
#### Metabolism:
Primarily metabolized in the liver.
The metabolism of SN-38 is similar to irinotecan, including glucuronidation.
### 4. Clinical Trials
#### IMMU-132-01:
A pivotal trial in TNBC patients demonstrated favorable objective response rates (ORR) and significant survival benefits.
#### ASCENT Trial:
Confirmed the efficacy of Trodelvy in metastatic TNBC, showing significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to traditional chemotherapy.
### 5. Common Side Effects
#### Trodelvy may cause the following side effects:
Hematologic Toxicity: Neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia.
Gastrointestinal Toxicity: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (a common effect of SN-38).
Alopecia (Hair Loss).
Fatigue.
Infections: Increased risk of infections due to immune suppression.
### 6. Clinical Significance
Trodelvy represents a breakthrough in precision cancer therapy, combining the specificity of antibody targeting with the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy. It offers an effective treatment option, especially for patients with cancers that are resistant to conventional therapies.

### 7. Regulatory Approvals
FDA Approval: First approved in 2020 for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.
Global Availability: Approved in various countries, including the European Union, Japan, and China.
